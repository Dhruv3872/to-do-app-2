# to-do app:

- A most basic version of a react-router app to showcase using react-router as framework with the following features:
  - React Redux
  - Redux Saga
  - Authentication
  - Axios
  - Mock Adapter
  - Exception handling

## Changes introduced in this commit:

- Changed the theme color because `red` seemed inapropriate.
- Commented `App.css` since its contents are not used anywhere in the app as of now.
- Made changes to the `body` HTML element type selector in `index.css` to center  
  the body content with respect to the page.
- Removed commented and/or redundant code and added styling-related code to  
  `Login`, `LoginForm`, and `Register` components to give the app a modest material-design look.
