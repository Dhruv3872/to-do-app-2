# to-do app:

- A most basic version of a react-router app to showcase using react-router as framework with the following features:
  - React Redux
  - Redux Saga
  - Authentication
  - Axios
  - Mock Adapter
  - Exception handling

## Changes in this commit:

- Added a not-so-sensible `theme` component (so that we can see its application to the app clearly) and provided it to the app using `ThemeProvider`.
