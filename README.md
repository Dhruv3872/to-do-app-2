# to-do app:

- A most basic version of a react-router app to showcase using react-router as framework with the following features:
  - React Redux
  - Redux Saga
  - Authentication
  - Axios
  - Mock Adapter
  - Exception handling

## Changes introduced in this commit:

- Renamed ProtectedRoutes to ProtectedLayout since it renders Outlet to show relevant components  
  instead of being used as a route itself.
