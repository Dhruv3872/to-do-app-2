# to-do app:

- A most basic version of a react-router app to showcase using react-router as framework with the following features:
  - React Redux
  - Redux Saga
  - Authentication
  - Axios
  - Mock Adapter
  - Exception handling

## Changes introduced in this commit:

- Increased the width of the `AddTask` `Dialog` box.
- Added `AppBar` mui component to give title to the Dashboard page,  
  to have a header-like component at the top of the page, and  
  to shift the Logout button to the top right corner of the page.
- Added Grid, margin, padding, width, height, and alignment to  
  the `Dashboard` component to give a modest material-design look  
  to the dashboard page.
